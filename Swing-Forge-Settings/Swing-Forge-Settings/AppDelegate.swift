/* TestFlight Notes
I added Tyler to LSG iTunes Dev team as admin so he can be an internal tester and add testers (this should happen as soon as he accepts invitation)

I added a version of SwingForge to my/Julian iTunes Connect and submitted for review with external testers, once approved this is probably the better route, just not sure how long this will take.
